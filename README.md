Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for detecting heart disease, leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques. With heart disease being a leading cause of mortality in the United States, this endeavor aims to provide a tool for early detection and intervention. The project utilizes Python programming language and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. The dataset encompasses various risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and demographic information. Through the implementation of classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, the goal is to build a robust predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.
